Memthol is a visualizer for memory profiling data generated from [OCaml] programs.


# Resources

- [Memthol's small tutorial][tuto]


# Features

- [x] multi-client: open several tabs in your browser for the same profiling session to visualize
    the data separately
- [x] self-contained: the BUI packs all its static assets, once you have the binary you do not need
    anything else (except a browser)
- [x] data-splitting: plot several families of data separately in the same chart by separating them
    based on size, allocation lifetime, source locations in the allocation callstack, *etc.*
- [ ] multiple metrics to plot different kinds of data: allocation lifetime, size, time of creation,
    *etc.*
- [ ] flamegraphs


# What It Looks Like

# Browser Compatibility

Memthol is mostly tested on the Chrome web browser. You might experience problems with other
browser, in which case we recommend you open an [issue][memthol issues].


# Dump Files

Memthol's current official input format is memory dumps produced by [*Memtrace*][memtrace] ([on
github][memtrace git]). A memtrace dump for a program execution is a single [**C**ommon **T**race
**F**ormat](https://diamon.org/ctf) (CTF) file.

Note that this repository contains a minimal Memtrace example in [`rsc/memtrace_example`][memtrace
example].


# Build

## Pre-requisites

Since memthol's UI is browser-based, it has a client written in [Rust] that compiles to [web
assembly] (wasm). To do this, you need to have the [rust toolchain].

- add the wasm target for rustup:

    ```bash
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```

- make sure everything is up to date with

    ```bash
    rustup update
    ```

- make sure you have [wasm-pack] installed so that Rust can compile the client

    installation instructions [here][install wasm-pack], although `cargo install wasm-pack` should
    work

- install [`cargo-make`][cargo make] with `cargo install cargo-make`

Memthol UI's dependencies rely on some OS-level packages. Please make sure they are installed and in
your path:

- build essentials (including `cmake`)
- openssl/libssl
- freetype
- expat

## `debug`

> **NB**: memthol is quite slow in `debug` mode. If you have a lot of data to process, definitely
> build in release instead.

To build memthol in `debug` mode, run

```bash
cargo make build
```

The memthol binary will be in `target/debug/memthol`

### `release`

To build memthol in `release` mode, run

```bash
cargo make release
```

The memthol binary will be in `./memthol_ui`, also available as `target/release/memthol`.

# Testing

Run memthol-ui on the test files located on this repository, in `rsc/ctf/mini_ae.ctf` to make sure
it works. Assuming your binary is called `memthol` and is in you path, and you are at the root of
this repository:

```bash
memthol rsc/dumps/ctf/mini_ae.ctf
```

There is a bigger set of data you can use for testing, although we recommend you build in `release`
mode for this one:

```bash
memthol rsc/dumps/ctf/flambda.ctf
```
