//! Types and parsers for memthol's dump structures.
//!
//! These types are used by memthol's client when loading up memthol diffs.
//!
//! Generally speaking, all the types in this crate are parsed, not created from scratch. There is
//! no [`Uid`] factory for instance, since we will not have to generate fresh `Uid`s. We will only
//! parse them, the fact that they're unique must be guaranteed by whoever generated them.
//!
//! The entry point in terms of parsing is [`Diff`], since (currently) the only way the client can
//! build the other types is when parsing a `Diff`.
//!
//! # Dealing With Time
//!
//! There are two types to handle time: [`Date`] and [`SinceStart`]. The former encodes an absolute
//! date, while the latter is a only a duration. Memthol's init file specifies the `Date` at which
//! the program we're profiling started. After that, all the allocation data relies on `SinceStart`
//! to refer to point in times relative to the start date.
//!
//! [`Uid`]: base::uid::Alloc (The Alloc struct)
//! [`Date`]: base::time::Date (The Date struct)
//! [`SinceStart`]: base::time::SinceStart (The SinceStart struct)
